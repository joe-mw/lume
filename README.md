If the movie or show is not available in the xtream playlist, a message will be shown to the user. If multiple streams are available, the user will be able to choose which stream to play (different qualities, etc.). The movie or show details view will also have a section for related movies or shows (similar movies or shows based on genre, etc.) and a section for recommended movies or shows (based on watch history, etc. - future feature).
- For shows: Selection of season and episode, with the same features as movies (checking availability in the xtream playlist, etc.)

##### View
- Icons at the header: Back button on the left. Option to mark the movie or show as watched (eye icon) and favorite (heart icon) on the right.

### Settings
In the settings, users will be able to manage their xtream playlist (credentials and other information from the server information like active connections and expiration date), customize player settings (aspect ratio, subtitles, etc.), manage their content (refresh interval, hide/show categories, reorder categories or channels, etc.) and customize the appearance of the app (dark mode, etc.).

## Content indexing
The app will index the content from the xtream playlist and EPG data, allowing for fast and efficient searching and browsing. The indexed data will be stored locally on the device using SwiftData, providing offline access to the content.
This also includes the ability to hide / show specific categories or channels, and reorder them according to user preferences.
Additionally, the indexing enables features like progression tracking, watch history, personalized recommendations, etc. in the future.
