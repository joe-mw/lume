//
//  EPGFocusStrip.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The tvOS guide's single real focus target plus its edge sentinels. The
//  engine only consults `shouldUpdateFocus` when a move has a candidate
//  target — with nothing focusable inside the guide, moves towards its
//  interior would be silently ignored. The sentinels hug the strip so every
//  interior direction always yields a proposal; the veto then reads the
//  move's *heading* (not which view the engine picked) and forwards it to the
//  guide's virtual navigation, covering remote presses *and* swipes even when
//  a strong neighbour like the tab bar is the engine's proposed target.
//
//  The one move that leaves the guide is left from the channel hub. A
//  full-height view projects its focus from screen centre, so the engine
//  finds no candidate on the top-aligned rail; and driving the SwiftUI rail's
//  focus state from here loses a fight with the UIKit strip (focus falls back
//  to the tab bar). So a `UIFocusGuide` at the leading edge points at the
//  rail's *container* view (the left-adjacent sibling, found by walking up):
//  the engine descends into it and focuses a category — pure UIKit, no
//  SwiftUI focus fight, and independent of where focus entered from. The
//  guide is live only while the strip holds focus: enabled on the unfocused
//  strip it would swallow every entry move from the rail instead.
//
//  Menu is deliberately *not* handled here. A responder-chain `pressesBegan`
//  loses to an enclosing NavigationStack's own Menu recognizer (focus hops to
//  the tab bar), and a competing recognizer with blanket precedence freezes
//  the engine's directional recognizers. The scroller handles Menu with
//  SwiftUI's `onExitCommand`, which takes the press before the stack does;
//  `railExitToken` is its hand-off back into UIKit for the hub → rail step.
