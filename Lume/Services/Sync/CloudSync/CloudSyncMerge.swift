// *shadow baseline*. Keeping it free of SwiftData / CloudKit lets it be unit
// tested exhaustively and reasoned about in isolation — the engine
// (`CloudSyncEngine`) only translates its verdicts into store mutations.
//
// Three-way merge means each side is compared not against the other but against
// the value we last saw agreed (`shadow`). That single idea handles create,
// update, *and* delete in both directions, because "absent" is just `nil`:
//
//   • local changed, cloud didn't            → push local (incl. local == nil ⇒ delete cloud)
//   • cloud changed, local didn't            → pull cloud (incl. cloud == nil ⇒ delete local)
//   • both changed the same way              → nothing to do, just re-baseline
//   • both changed differently (a conflict)  → field-level merge per the policy
//
// Without the shadow you cannot tell an edit from a delete (both look like
// "different from the other side"), which is what makes naive two-way mirrors
// resurrect deleted rows.
